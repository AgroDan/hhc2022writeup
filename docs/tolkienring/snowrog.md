# Snowrog

The dreaded Snowrog did not speak, but only roared. At least that's what I can surmise given the introduction of the great beast.

!!! quote "Snowrog Introduction"
	_Fierce gusts of wind wreath about it and snow swirls in its aura_

	_Its frozen mane shimmers, and chilled air fogs behind it_

	_Its left hand made of fingers of tongue-affixing icicles_

	_Its right a fist like that of a densely packed snowball_

	_The Snowrog focuses on you with an icy-cold glare_

	_And bellows a roar more thunderous than an avalanche_
