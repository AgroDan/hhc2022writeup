# Snowrog

```
_Fierce gusts of wind wreath about it and snow swirls in its aura_

_Its frozen mane shimmers, and chilled air fogs behind it_

_Its left hand made of fingers of tongue-affixing icicles_

_Its right a fist like that of a densely packed snowball_

_The Snowrog focuses on you with an icy-cold glare_

_And bellows a roar more thunderous than an avalanche_
