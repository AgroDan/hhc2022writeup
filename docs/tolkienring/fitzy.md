Fitzy was right next to the `Suricata Regatta` challenge terminal.

	Hm?.. Hello...

	Sorry, I don't mean to be uncharaceristically short with you.

	There's just this abominable Snowrog here, and I'm trying to comprehend Suricata to stop it from getting into the kitchen.

	I believe that if I can phrase these Suricata incantations correctly, they'll create a spell that will generate warnings.

	And hopefully those warnings will scare off the Snowrog!

	Only... I'm quite baffled. Maybe you can give it a go?


After completing the Suricata Regatta challenge (spoilers!):

	Woo hoo - you wielded Suricata magnificently! Thank you!

	Now to shout the final warning of power to the Snowrog...

	YOU...SHALL NOT...PASS!!!


And now...no more Snowrog!
