# About Me

![Agr0](/img/agr0.png)

Hello. My name is Dan. Or Agr0. Or Agr0_Dan, depending on what platform you are contacting me on.

I hack things for fun and prevent things from being hacked for profit. I also like yoyos and video games. I enjoy coding and flying drones. I can't get enough sushi and ramen. I have an awesome daughter that can legitimately say she has successfully exploited a Windows 7 machine using Eternal Blue when she was 5 years old. I have an amazing wife that reminds me every day how lucky I am. And most importantly, I have an incredible family that puts up with me while I diligently complete the Holiday Hack Challenge every single year.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/AgroDan) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agr0dan).

I have [a website](https://agrohacksstuff.io).
