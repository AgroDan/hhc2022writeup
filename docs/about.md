Hello. My name is Dan. Or Agr0. Or Agr0_Dan, depending on what platform you are contacting me on.

I hack things for fun and prevent things from being hacked for profit. I also like yoyos and video games. I enjoy sushi and ramen. 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/AgroDan) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agr0dan).

I have [a website](https://agrohacksstuff.io).
