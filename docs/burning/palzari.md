She was a sweetheart unless you doublecross her.

Hello, dear. Come down to visit your tiddly elf friend?

You two are just adorable, playing hero and braving our flaming domain.

Sure, we'll tolerate you playing here, but please behave, won't you?

Use this KTM to buy your darling little hats, and nothing more. If you decide to be a brat, well...

I'll disappear you into the Devnull Chasm, and nobody will ever see you again. Do we have an understanding?

Very good. Run along now, dear.
```

After completing the final ring:

```
Tsk tsk tsk, I thought I told you to play nice?

The only reason you're not in time-out is because Luigi doesn't seem convinced that you're a little rascal.

He's not as clever as he likes to think. But once he comes around...

You better watch out, dear. And when I catch you, you better not cry. Or do, not even Santa will hear you.
