# Count Chorizo, Herald of Repugnance

Chorizo was a dignified Sporc of high society. I guess he as a Sporc influencer or something. I don't know, I can't keep track of what kids watch these days.

!!! quote "Chorizo"
	Do you not have the slightest inclination of who I am?

	How did I, Count Chorizo, Herald of Rrrrepugnance, not receive an invitation to the presale?

	I could purchase every one of your wares, but now you shan't have a single cent from me!

	I will see to it that you **nevah** do business in these warrens agayn!

After completing the Bored Sporc Rowboat Society challenge (spoilers!):

??? quote "Chorizo"
	_Well...I...never..._

	How was a plebeian such as yourself granted access to the pre-sale?

	I present thee with a proffer to purchase the NFT you've acquired for twice the price.

	Hwhat? You shan't vend to me? Have you any idea who I am?

	You just refused the abhorrent Count Chorizo!

	I shall ensure you are **nevah** able to transact with that NFT agayn!
