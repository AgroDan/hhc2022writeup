	Psst. Hey, slick - over here. Myeah.

	You look like a sucker _ahem_ I mean, savvy.

	I got some exclusive, very rare, very valuable NFTs for sale.

	But I run a KringleCoin-only business. Kapeesh?

	Ever buy somethin' with cryptocurrency before?

	Didn't think so, but if you wheel and deal with ya' pal Luigi here, now you can!

	But we're currently in pre-sale, and you gotta be on the list. Myeah, see?

	BSRS NFTs are a swell investment. They'll be worth a pretty penny, and that's a promise.

	So when they're purchasable, you better snatch 'em up before the other boneheads _ahem_ I mean, eggheads do.

	I got a business to run. You can't buy nothin' right now, so scram. Kapeesh?

After completing the Bored Sporc Rowboat Society challenge (spoilers!):

	What!? How'd you get on the list? What's that? You's a double agent, and you're actually workin' for us?

	I don't know if I buy that, but you're on the list, so... myeah.

	Somethin' about this ain't sittin' right with me, but there's no reversing transactions with cryptocurrency.

	That NFT is yours to keep, but if I find out you're lyin' to me, Palzari's gonna pay you a visit. Kapeesh?
