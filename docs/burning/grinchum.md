😠 _We wants them... we needs them... Must.. have.. the Preciouses._

_They stole them from us, sneaky little humanses._

🙂 _No, not the humanses, they're my friends._

😏 _You don't have any friends. NOBODY likes YOU. You're a liar, and a thief, and a.... grriiiiiiinch._

😢 _Go away... we don't need you anymore. The humanses protect us now._

😠 _Go away? I protected us. The preciouses are safe because of ME!_

🙂 _Leave now, and never.. come back._ 😃 _Leave now, and never.. come back!_

😁_LEAVE NOW, AND NEVER.. COME BACK!_😬

**Friendly human, please go to jolly human's castle! Go on, we will meet you there!**
