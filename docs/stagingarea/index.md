# Chapter I

## Objective 1: Orientation

Our journey begins - yet again - at the North Pole. The new one, apparently. I imagine that Santa has a difficult time setting up shop [every time the north pole moves](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52550973). But Christmas magic does what it does, and it's not my job to question it.

Here I am in the Staging area!

Clicking on the KTM kiosk allows me to create a wallet:

	*KringleCoin Teller Machine - Account Creation*

	Welcome to the KringleCoin Network! We're glad you're here!

	Hello! This system is designed to help you with the process of creating a cryptocurrency wallet!  
	We will do all of the tedious, difficult work for you - you just need to do one, **_VERY_** important thing:  
	  
	We're going to be showing you some very important information: _YOU will **need** to keep track of it._  
	  
	If you lose the private key to your wallet... well, we don't even want to think about that.  
	Probably the only thing on earth that could save you is some genuine Santa-type magic...  
	  
	So please **_(PLEASE)_** get prepared to copy down the information we're going to present to you on the next screen.


Followed by:

!!! info "KringleCoin Teller Machine"
	*Welcome to the KringleCoin Network! We're glad you're here!*

	It appears that you currently do not have a KringleCoin wallet.  
	You'll need one while you're here at the North Pole.  
	  
	Let's get started and set up your wallet.  
	You'll earn KringleCoins for completing challenges or you just  
	might be lucky enough to find some! Who knows!  
	  
	  
	Your KringleCoin wallet consists of two values, a WalletAddress and a Private (Secret) Key.  
	  
	**_This is critically important: YOU are responsible for keeping track of your account information.  
	  
	If you come back here, we can tell you your WalletAddress, but (and this is very, VERY important)  
	We CANNOT tell you your secret key. If you lose it, you lose access to your KringleCoins._**  
	  
	Here is your KringleCoin wallet information:  
	  
	WalletAddress: *0x0C32F9ED96F12fD7cd090870fd22fD4e53799428*
	Key: *< redacted >*
	  
	  
	**_COPY THIS INFORMATION TO SOMEWHERE SAFE. DO NOT LOSE IT!_**

After obtaining my wallet address and key, I am tasked now to perform the terminal challenge.

Simply typing the word `answer` will allow me to continue. This opens the gate to the Kringle Castle Approach!
