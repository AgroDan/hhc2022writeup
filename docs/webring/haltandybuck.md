# Hal Tandybuck

This guy was a lot nicer than the last Flobbit I came across.

Oh hi, I'm Hal Tandybuck. And who might you be?

I'm hanging out by the door to the mines here because, well, I haven't figured out the locks yet.

It actually reminds me of this locked crate I had three years ago...

I doubt we'll get much in the way of debug output.

Think you can help me get through?

After solving the Boria Mine Door challenge:

```
Great! Thanks so much for your help!

When you get to the fountain inside, there are some things you should consider.

First, it might be helpful to focus on Glamtariel's CAPITALIZED words.

If you finish those locks, I might just have another hint for you!

Wha - what?? You opened all the locks?! Well then...

Did you see the nearby terminal with evidence of an XXE attack?

Maybe take a close look at that kind of thing.

Upon completing the Boria Mine Door challenge, I now had access to the next room: The Fountain!
