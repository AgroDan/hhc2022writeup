Each had entrances to the pathways to all of the golden rings of power! As well as a few characters to speak to. Each ring can be done out of order, but in the interest of consistency, the first challenge should be in the [Tolkien Ring Room](/tolkienring/index.md), followed by the [Elfen Ring Room](/elfenring/index.md), then the [Web Ring Room](/webring/index.md), the [Cloud Ring Room](/cloudring/index.md), and finally the [Burning Ring of Fire](/burning/index.md)!
