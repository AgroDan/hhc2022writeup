# Hidden Chests

There were three hidden chests in the underground cave system outside the challenges.

The first was found right by the second ladder.

The second hidden chest was found by climbing a secret ladder to the left of the door to the Web Ring.

The third hidden chest was found right near the door to the Burning Ring of Fire. It was a blind maze that took a little bit of figuring out to complete.

This third chest contained a neato hat!
