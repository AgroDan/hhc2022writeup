Morcel was hanging out near the Elfen Ring.

```
Hello, I'm Morcel Nougat, elf extraordinaire!

I was in the first group of elves that started digging into the snow.

Eventually, we burrowed deep enough that we came upon an already existing tunnel network.

As we explored it, we encountered a people that claimed to be the Flobbits.

We were all astonished, because we learn a little about the Flobbits in history class, but nobody's ever seen them.

They were part of the Great Schism hundreds of years ago that split the Munchkins and the Elves.

Not much else was known, until we met them in the tunnels! Turns out, their exodus took them to Middle Earth.

They only appear when the 5 Rings are in jeopardy. Though, the Rings weren't lost until after we started digging. Hmm...

Anyways, be careful as you venture down further. I hear something sinister is in the depths of these tunnels.
