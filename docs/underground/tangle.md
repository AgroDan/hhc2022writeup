# Tangle Coalbox

Tangle was hanging out right outside the Cloud Ring.

Hey there, Gumshoe. Tangle Coalbox here again.

Morcel told you all about the Flobbits, right? Well, be careful ahead.

Once thought to be the stuff of myths, the Sporcs truly are real, and as mean as they are in the stories.

Once we gained the Flobbits' trust, they taught us all about the Sporcs. They, too, were part of the Great Schism.

They were another people who split off from the colony of Frostians in Oz, though, they're more closely related to the trolls.

The Flobbits, on the other hand, are more like the Munchkins. Like the Flobbits, the Sporcs appear when the rings are at risk.

Digging far down into the ground causes them to emerge, too. Seems we created a perfect storm. Whoops!

They're definitely up to no good, and trying to get the Rings for themselves. Tread lightly, friend, and good luck!
