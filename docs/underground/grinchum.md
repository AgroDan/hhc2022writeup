Grinchum was found right near the entrance to the Tolkien Ring. He originally did not have much to say.

	_My..._

	_Preciousesss...._

	_Don't worry, you are hidden. You are safe._

However, as time went by and more rings were collected, Grinchum would say more interesting (and somewhat disturbing) things. Not very Christmas-y of you, Grinchum.
