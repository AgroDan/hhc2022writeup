# Smilegol

```
I must give you my most thankful of thanks, and most sorry of sorries.

I'm not sure what happened, but I just couldn't resist the Rings' call.

But once you returned the Rings to Santa, I was no longer so spellbound.

I could think clearly again, so I shouted off that awful persona.

And that grouchy Grinchum was gone for good. Now, I can be me again, just in time for gift giving.

This is a lesson I won't soon forget, and I certainly won't forget you.

I wish you smooth sailing on wherever your next voyage takes you!
