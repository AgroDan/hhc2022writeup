Welcome to my 2022 Holiday Hack Challenge writeup! I had a lot of fun this year and hope you all had fun as well. This year we find ourselves back at the North Pole to celebrate the Five Gold Rings celebration...and to see that this year's theme is Lord of the Rings! Since I'm a tremendous LOTR nerd I was especially excited about this one.

There are two basic ways to read this writeup. The first, if you are just interested in the answers to the challenges, Please check out the [Challenges](challenges.md) page, which has links to each challenge directly. However, if you want to explore the maps and layout of each section of the event, I implore you to review [The Journey](stagingarea/index.md).
