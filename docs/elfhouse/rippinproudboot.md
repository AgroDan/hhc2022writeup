# Rippin Proudboot

Doesn't do much until you solve the prison escape challenge.

```
Have you managed to help Tinsel with his prison escape?
```

After I solved the `Prison Escape` challenge, Rippin had a few more things to say:

```
Yes, hello, I'm Rippin Proudboot. Can I help you?

Oh, you'd like to help me? Well, I'm not quite sure you can, but we shall see.

The elves here introduced me to this new CI/CD technology. It seems quite efficient.

Unfortunately, the sporcs seem to have gotten their grubby mits on it as well, along with the Elfen Ring.

They've used CI/CD to launch a website, and the Elfen Ring to power it.

Might you be able to check for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in their CI/CD pipeline?

If you do find anything, use it to exploit the website, and get the ring back!
```

After I solved the Jolly CI-CD pipeline challenge:

```
How unexpected, you were actually able to help!

Well, then I must apoligize for my dubious greeting.

Us Flobbits can't help it sometimes, it's just in our nature.

Right then, there are other Flobbits that need assistance further into the burrows.

Thank you, and off you go.
```

What a jerk.
