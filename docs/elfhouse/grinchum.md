The Grinchum is here after I finished the Jolly CI/CD pipeline challenge.

	😖 _A second Precious is gone! Now we only have three._

	🤨 **Why are you humanses nagging us? We are busy.** _grinchum..grinchum_

	**You want to know about us? If we tell the naggy human, will it go away? Fine...**

	🥺 **The jolly human and the elfses locked up the Preciouses, but I freed them all, and together we escaped.**

	**We fled, and we were so alone. We soon forgot the taste of Lembanh, the softness of snowflakes falling, even our name.**

	**And we only wanted to eat raw fish: nigiri, maki, or shashimi. But we most likes gnawing the whole, living fish, so juicy sweet.**

	**Then we saw the Sporcses, and they wanted my Preciouses all to themselves.**

	**And the humanses came, but they just want coinses for their silly hats.**

	**We only meant to protect you, Preciouses, from the naughty Elfses and Flobbitses and Sporcses, so we locked you away.**

	😏 **Now leave us alone, naggy human, we must find the two missing Preciouses.**
