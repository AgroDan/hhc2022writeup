# Castle Approach

Behold, Kringle Castle!

There were quite a few characters here to interact with. First of all, Santa was here! And next to a KTM terminal as well for our convenience.

Santa had this to say:

```
Welcome to the North Pole, intrepid traveler!

Wow, we had quite a storm last night!

My castle door is sealed shut behind a giant snowbank.

The Elves have decided to burrow under the snow to get everything ready for our holiday deliveries.

But there's another wrinkle: my Five Golden Rings have _gone missing_.

Without the magic of the Rings, we simply can't launch the holiday season.

My reindeer won't fly; I won't be able to zip up and down chimneys.

What's worse, without the magic Rings, I can't fit the millions of cookies in my belly!

I challenge you to go on a quest to find and retrieve each of the five Rings.

I'll put some initial goals in your badge for you.

The holidays, and the whole world, are counting on you.
```

Welp, looks like we have 5 golden rings to find.
