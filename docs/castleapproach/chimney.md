You may be wondering where Frost Tower from last year went.

Well, it turns out the entire tower was a giant rocketship!

After the Frostians returned last year and brought Jack Frost to justice…

The entire building launched into space, returning Jack and the Trolls to their home planet.

So that concluded last year’s caper! But I hear that something is amiss this year too!

Some of my fellow elves have burrowed under the snow, and even deeper.

They’ve uncovered some strange stuff down there!

You should definitely check it out!
