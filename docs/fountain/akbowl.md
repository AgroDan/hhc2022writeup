	Huh - what? Why do you disturb Akbowl?

	I'm trying to get the ring in here for the Sporc Chief.

	Unlucky for me it's lost in this water basin thing.

	You will _not_ get it out before Akbowl!

Spoiler alert: you will get it out before Akbowl.

After solving Glamtariel's Fountain:

	No! That's not yours!

	This birdbath showed me images of this happening.

	But I didn't believe it because nobody is better than Akbowl!

	Akbowl's head is the hardest! That's what the other sporcs tell me.

	I guess Akbowl's head is not the smartest.


Also, you can stand on the fountain if you'd like.
