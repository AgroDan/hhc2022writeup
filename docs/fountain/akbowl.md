# Akbowl

Akbowl was a Sporc.

```
Huh - what? Why do you disturb Akbowl?

I'm trying to get the ring in here for the Sporc Chief.

Unlucky for me it's lost in this water basin thing.

You will _not_ get it out before Akbowl!
```

Spoiler alert: you will get it out before Akbowl.

```
No! That's not yours!

This birdbath showed me images of this happening.

But I didn't believe it because nobody is better than Akbowl!

Akbowl's head is the hardest! That's what the other sporcs tell me.

I guess Akbowl's head is not the smartest.
```

Also, you can stand on the fountain somehow.
