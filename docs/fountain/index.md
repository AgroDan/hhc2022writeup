# Glamtariel's Fountain

This final challenge for the Web Ring was a Sporc simply staring into a fountain. Accessing the fountain presents you with a strange challenge involving type confusion that was a little too CTF-y for my liking, but it was neat regardless.

This room was relatively simple as it only consisted of a fountain, as well as Grinchum who really only shows up after the Challenge is complete.
